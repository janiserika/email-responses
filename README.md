Hi Raju,

It seems that we marked you as absent during our last class because you were only able to stay for **10 minutes** during the session. Based on our [zoom meeting records](https://zoom.us/meeting/84480856998?occurrence=1624743000000/details), you joined at **11:45 AM** and left at **12:05 PM** when our class schedule is from **11:45 AM to 12:45 PM**.
As stated in our [course policies](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/ios_university/policies_remote_fall19), students who stay less than half of the total number of hours of the session will be marked as absent from the class. We only allow three absences so we advise that you stay at least half of the session time to avoid being marked as absent.
We are very strict in implementing our polices so please take time to review our [course policies](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/ios_university/policies_remote_fall19). If you have further questions, please let us know.

All the best,
CodePath.org Team
